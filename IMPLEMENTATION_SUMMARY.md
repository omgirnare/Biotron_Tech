## üîí Security Features

1. **Access Control**: Doctors can only view patient data if explicit permission exists
2. **Permission Validation**: Backend validates all access requests
3. **Role-based Authorization**: Different endpoints require different user roles
4. **Data Isolation**: Patients cannot access other patients' data
5. **Immediate Revocation**: Access is removed immediately when revoked

## üöÄ API Endpoints

### Access Management
- `POST /access/grant-access` - Grant access to a doctor
- `POST /access/revoke-access` - Revoke access from a doctor
- `GET /access/my-permissions` - Get current permissions (patients)
- `GET /access/my-patients` - Get patients who granted access (doctors)
- `GET /access/check-access/:patientId` - Check if doctor has access to patient

### Patient Profiles
- `GET /patients/me` - Get own profile (patients)
- `GET /patients/:id` - Get patient profile (with access control)
- `POST /patients` - Create patient profile
- `PUT /patients/:id` - Update patient profile

## üß™ Testing Instructions

1. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1 - Start server
   cd server && npm run dev
   
   # Terminal 2 - Start client
   cd client && npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test the complete flow:**
   - Register as a patient and doctor
   - Login as patient and create a profile
   - Grant access to a doctor
   - Login as doctor and view patient data
   - Test revoking access
   - Verify doctor loses access immediately

3. **Verify security:**
   - Try to access patient data without permission
   - Verify access control works correctly
   - Test permission revocation
